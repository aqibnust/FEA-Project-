# FEA-Project-
 performed Static Structural and Explicit Dynamics simulations on a custom-designed pentagonal model using ANSYS. I created the geometry, assigned material properties based on my roll number, applied fixed support and remote loading, and ran a full mesh-convergence study. My loads were defined from my date of birth and the USD→PKR exchange rate.
